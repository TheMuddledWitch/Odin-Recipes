    <h2>Now, these aren’t some ordinary bite-size cookies. No these are a full-on meal. Well maybe for some people. Here’s the deal – you make them big. Really big. Like only four can fit on a cookie sheet, BIG. These are the BEST CHOCOLATE CHIP COOKIES EVER. Yep, I said it.</h2>
    <p>You may want to eat these Levain Bakery Chocolate Chip Cookies the second they come out of the oven, but patience is a virtue and you must exercise some with these cookies. They need to “set up” so give them at least 10-15 minutes before you devour them. The amazing part of these cookies is that they are the only cookies I have ever made that are still cookie perfection even after a few days.</p>
    
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>1 cup Cold Butter cut into small cubes</li>
        <li>1 cup Brown Sugar</li>
        <li>1/2 cup Sugar</li>
        <li>2 Eggs</li>
        <li>1 1/2 cups Cake Flour*</li>
        <li>1 1/2 cups Flour</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon Cornstarch</li>
        <li>3/4 teaspoon Baking Soda</li>
        <li>3/4 teaspoon Salt</li>
        <li>2 cups Chocolate Chips</li>
        <li>*Optional* 2 cups Walnuts roughly chopped</li>
      
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>

    
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 410 degrees.</li>
            <li>In a large mixing bowl, cream together cold cubed butter, brown sugar, and sugar for 4 minutes or until creamy.</li>
            <li>Add eggs, one at a time, mixing well after each one.</li>
            <li>Stir in flours, cornstarch, baking soda, and salt. Mix until just combined to avoid overmixing. Stir in chocolate chips and walnuts.</li>
            <li>Separate dough into large balls and place on lightly colored cookie sheet. They are bigger than you think! You will fit 4 cookies on one large cookie sheet. The dough makes 8 extra large cookies.</li>
            <li>Bake for 9-12 minutes or until golden brown on the top. Let them rest for at least 10 minutes to set.</li>
        </ol>

    <h3><em>Notes</em></h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Can substitute all-purpose flour for cake flour</li>
            <li>Levain Bakery has stated they don't use vanilla extract in their cookies. If you would like to add vanilla extract, I would suggest adding 1 teaspoon when adding the eggs to the batter. </li>
